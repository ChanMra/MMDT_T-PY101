## **How to Submit to the Classroom Repository (GitHub Classroom)**  
You can submit your work to the GitHub Classroom repository in two ways:  

1. **Using the Web Version (GitHub Web Interface)**  
2. **Using VS Code (Git + GitHub Integration)**

## **1. Using the Web Version**
If you prefer to upload your work directly via GitHubâ€™s website, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Open Your Classroom Repository**
- Go to **GitHub Classroom** and find the assignment repository link your instructor provided.  
- Click on the repository link. You should see a page that says something like:  
  > `This repository was created for your assignment.`  
- Your own repo should look like this:

  > `Added my solution for assignment X`
- Click **"Commit changes"** to submit.

### **Step 3: Stage and Commit the Changes**

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed assignment submission"
  ```

### **Step 4: Push to GitHub**
- Push your changes to GitHub with:

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

## **3. Using VS Code (Git + GitHub Integration)**
If you are working on your code in **VS Code**, follow these steps to submit it using Git commands.

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
- Open **VS Code** and open the **Terminal** (use `Ctrl + ~` shortcut).
- Run this command to **clone** the repository (replace with your actual repo link):

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/iSTAREducation/intro-computerscience-python-arnav-kalavagunta.git
  ```
- Navigate into the project folder:

  ```bash
  cd YOUR-CLASSROOM-REPO
  ```

### **Step 2: Add Your Work**
- Copy your files into the cloned repository folder.  

### **Step 3: Stage and Commit the Changes**
- Run the following commands in the terminal:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Completed assignment submission"
  ```

### **Step 4: Push to GitHub**
- Push your changes to GitHub with:

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** If your branch is named `master` instead of `main`, use `git push origin master` instead.
